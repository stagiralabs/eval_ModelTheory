# The First Order Theory of Algebraically Closed Fields

This file defines the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic `p`, as well
as proving completeness of the theory and the Lefschetz Principle.

## Main definitions

* `FirstOrder.Language.Theory.ACF p` : the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic
  `p` as a theory over the language of rings.
* `FirstOrder.Field.ACF_isComplete` : the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic
  `p` is complete whenever `p` is prime or zero.
* `FirstOrder.Field.ACF_zero_realize_iff_infinite_ACF_prime_realize` : the Lefschetz principle.

## Implementation details

To apply a theorem about the model theory of algebraically closed fields to a specific
algebraically closed field `K` which does not have a `Language.ring.Structure` instance,
you must introduce the local instance `compatibleRingOfRing K`. Theorems whose statement requires
both a `Language.ring.Structure` instance and a `Field` instance will all be stated with the
assumption `Field K`, `CharP K p`, `IsAlgClosed K` and `CompatibleRing K` and there are instances
defined saying that these assumptions imply `Theory.field.Model K` and `(Theory.ACF p).Model K`

## References

The first order theory of algebraically closed fields, along with the Lefschetz Principle and
the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem were first formalized in Lean 3 by Joseph Hua
[here](https://github.com/Jlh18/ModelTheoryInLean8) with the master's thesis
